# Chapter 1: Paragraph Structure
A paragraph is **a group of related sentences** that discuss one (and usually only one) main idea, A paragraph can be as short as one sentence or as long as ten sentences. The number of sentences is unimportant; however, the paragraph should be long enough to develop the main idea clearly.
A paragragh may**stand my itself**. In academic writing, you often write a paragraph to answer a test question. A paragraph may also bne one part of a longer piece of writing such as a essay or book.
We mark a paragraph by **indenting the first word** half an inch (five spaces on a computer) from the left margin.

## Reading:
1. The topic of the above paragraph is about Gold
2. Two main points that the writer made about the topic:
- Gold has a lustrous beauty that is resistant to corrosion.
- Gold is useful to industry and science.
3. In sentence 2 and 6.
4. Examples that the writer used to support each point:
- Point 1: A Macedonian coin that remain untarnished after 25 centuries.
- Point 2: Gold's applications in photography, dentistry and in astronauts' suit.
## The Three Parts of a Paragraph:
- All paragraphs have a **topic sentence** and **supporting sentences**, and some paragragh also have a **concluding sentence**.
 ---------------
- The topic sentence **states the main idea of the paragraph**. It **names the topic of the paragraph**, and limit the topic to one specific area that can be discussed completely in the space of a single paragraph.
- **_Controlling Idea_**: the part of the topic sentence that annouces the specific part to be dicussed.
- The topic sentence states both the topic and the controlling idea.
 ---------------
- Supporting sentences develop the topic sentence: They explain or prove the topic sentence by giving more information about it.
 ---------------
- Concluding sentence signals the end of the paragraph and leaves the reader with important points to remember.
- Concluding sentences are customary for stand-alone parapraphs. Paragraphs that are parts of a longer piece of writing usually do not need concluding sentences.

## The Topic Sentence:
  A topic sentence clearly states the topic and the controlling idea of the paragraph.
  A topic sentence is the most inportant sentence in a paragraph:
  - It briefly indicates what the paragraph is going to dicuss
  - It is a helpful guide to both the writer and the reader. The writer can see what information to include. The reader can see what the paragraph is going to be about.
  Three important points to remember about a topic sentence:
  - A topic sentence is a complete sentence: it contains at least one subject and one verb.
  - A topic sentence contains both a topic and a controlling idea. It names the topic and then limits the topic to a specific area to be dicussed in the space of a single paragraph.
  - A topic sentence is the most general statement in the paragraph because it gives only the main idea, and ano specific details.
### Position of Topic Sentences:
  The topic sentence is usually the first sentence in a paragraph. 
  Sometimes a topic sentence comes at the end. In this case, the paragraph often begins with a series of examples, Other paragraph may begins with a series of facts, and the topic sentence at the end is the conclusion from these facts.
